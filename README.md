# Final-Assessment-Multivariate-Statistical-Methods
This is the final take home exam for all spring students enrolled with STA 9705.

There are 4 questions in this exercise. The details of which are available inside the guidelines folder. Required files for analysis is provided inside the data folder.

## Exercise 1:
The data in the file iris.txt contain observations on X1 = Sepal length, X2 = Sepal width, X3 = Petal length and X4 = Petal width for samples from three species of iris (1 = Iris setosa; 2 = Iris versicolor; 3 = Iris virginica).

## Exercise 2:
The weekly rates of return for five stocks: JP Morgan, Citibank, Wells Fargo, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, listed on the New York Stock Exchange are given in filel stock_price.txt.

## Exercise 3:
A firm is attempting to evaluate the quality of its sales staff and is trying to find an exam-ination or series of tests that may reveal the potential for good performance in sales. The firm has selected a random sample of 50 sales people and has evaluated each on 3 measures of performance: X1 = growth of sales, X2 = profitability of sales, and X3 = new-account sales. Each of the 50 individuals took each of 4 tests, which purported to measure X4 = creativity, X5 = mechanical reasoning, X6 = abstract reasoning, and X7 = mathematical
ability, respectively. The data are given in file salesman.txt.

## Exercise 4:
The file university.txt gives the data on some universities for certain variables used to compare or rank major universities. These variables include X1 = average SAT score of new freshmen, X2 = percentage of new freshmen in top 10% of high school class, X3 = percentage of applicants accepted, X4 = student-faculty ratio, X5 = estimated annual expenses and X6 = graduation rate (%). Because SAT and Expenses are on a much different scale from that of the other variables, you need to standardize the data first.

**Answers to all the questions above is provided in the analysis folder [here](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/Final-Assessment-Multivariate-Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Analysis/STA%209705_Final%20Exam_TM.pdf)**
